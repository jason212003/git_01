## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done —
"It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun."
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In a world of dreams, where passion roams,
Upon the field, where victory's known,
A game unfolds, with grace and might,
Where heroes rise, in the heat of fight.

With a single ball, a symphony begins,
Feet dance in rhythm, as the battle spins,
The grass beneath, a canvas for dreams,
As players weave, in elegant streams.

From goal to goal, they swiftly glide,
With skill and precision, side by side,
Their feet converse, in a language unique,
Each touch, a tale, they beautifully speak.

The roar of the crowd, a thunderous cheer,
As the ball soars high, overcoming fear,
A collective heartbeat, the stadium shakes,
In unity, the passion awakens and breaks.

From dawn to dusk, the battle rages on,
Every tackle fought, every triumph won,
The beautiful game, a captivating sight,
Where nations collide, under the floodlights.

In jerseys adorned, they stand as one,
Representing nations, beneath the sun,
Where rivalries form, but respect remains,
A testament to the sport's noble veins.

With every pass, a story unfolds,
Of teamwork, dedication, and goals,
The goalposts witness, tales of the brave,
As legends etch their names, beyond the grave.

In victory's embrace, they bask and glow,
United in triumph, their spirits aglow,
But in defeat, they rise above the fall,
With heads held high, they conquer it all.

For soccer's spirit, eternally thrives,
In the hearts of those, on whom it survives,
A symphony of emotions, forever played,
In this beautiful game, where dreams are made.
